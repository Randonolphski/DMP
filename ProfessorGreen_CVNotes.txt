Case 2 – Professor Green Branched!

In this project, Professor Green and his team, two Masters students, will be collecting research data regarding teamwork in hospital environments. They have two primary means of data collection. The first will consist of 383 documents for a textual/content analysis; these files are currently in various formats and stored on Zotero. Quantitative data regarding the textual analysis is stored in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet The second type of data will be audio recordings and transcriptions from interviews with informants; audio recordings will be encoded in MP3 format at 128kbps. Professor Green will also utilize open source datasets regarding healthcare in his research. Currently, Professor Green stores his data in three locations: Zotero, Dropbox, and Google Docs. Our data management team suggests using part of the budget to purchase a secure database for storage. The first option we suggest is that Professor Green utilizes Dalhousie's' institutional repository which provides a stable URL, access control, and is easy to use. It can handle the different file formats Professor Green uses and he will be able to directly analyze his data. The second and third option are two cloud based repositories that Professor Green are familiar with and know how to use. The second option is purchasing a DropBox Business account for teams. The standard account costs $17.50 a month and provides 2 TB of storage; this will provide enough storage as Professor Green's research project grows. A DropBox Business account will provide storage, security, access from different locations, version history and file recovery, and advance sharing permissions that Professor Green can control. The third option is purchasing a G Suite Business account which gives more features to Google Docs. With this type of account, Professor Green has 1TB of cloud storage, administration controls, archive, and has a low price of $10 USD a month. Our suggestion is DropBox as Professor Green is familiar with it and can control the access to data. The data created by Professor Green's research is highly sensitive and he does not want this data shared with anyone. Any data created by his research will be encrypted before being deposited into DropBox and will have any identifying information anonymized. Original data will not be shared, but notes recorded by Green himself will be made accessible to his Masters students. 

To improve the use of Green's data, we will implement a metadata standard. Data created by his project will be tagged in XML using the Data Documentation Initiative format. This is a widely used international standard for describing data from both social and science fields. Metadata will provide context about data for his team since they will not be allowed to access data without Green's approval. Green will hold intellectual property rights for all his research data and information that is directly created by the project. Green is adamant that the data for this experiment is held closely, however if he were to publish this a copyright license will ensure that his data is not used by anyone.  

To protect the privacy of the informants, Professor Green will use an informed consent form. The form states that the researchers will not identify the participant by name in an information resulting from the interview and that confidentiality will be kept at all times. Data is subject to the standard practice of anonymizing data to ensure this privacy; any identifying information will be limited to Professor Green and will only be kept on the master copy on his USB key. During analysis and storage, only Green and approved members of his research team will be allowed to access sensitive data. Being being uploaded to DropBox, any direct identifies will be removed.
